# Introduction
A mutator utilizing the Custom Flags Framework which adds flag accessories to Eagles/Ravens which allows them to show off their assigned flag WITH FLAIR!

This mutator is purely for entertainment (and is also just a template for my framework if im being honest). I do not mean for this to reflect any pride/political related things happening in real life. In the end you are just fighting blocky people :0

This adds 5 accessories/meshes to the framework. You can find their names/ids in the Flag Viewer map.

This was made to work with the default skin. As such, custom skins may not work well with the accessories.

More information about the framework this mutator is dependent on can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3385310995).
